FORMULARY DESIGN
The following is the proprosed design for a formulary system for pharmaoffice:

A formulary system, is a system that tracks formularies across the country, it allows the pharmacy stock to be more compliant to a specific formulary,
different formularies are used, some can be used by hospitals, some are maintained for specific reasons. it helps the pharmacy know the type of medication that they should
priorities and the type that they shouldn't, one or more forumlary can be used at the same time 

first what are the benefits of using a formulary system:

MAKEUP:
Formularies are broken down into sections that can have subsections, each section comprises of a name, a datastore of medications and a list of sections that represents its
subsections, This therefore forms a tree like structure with the formulary containing all the roots. Sections are loaded and offloaded as needed. sections can aslo be cached in the system for easy access
or medications used most offen can be to avoid going to the network

Medications:
A single row in the datastore of a section represents a medication, a medication is made up of,a uuid, name, strength which is madeup of the qunatity and unit eg: g, mg, l, ml etc.
The dosage form, which includes tablets, capsules, iv, im etc more would be added as research continues. All these forms the unique identification for the medication
therefore, 3 medications can have the same everything except differ in strength and they are considered seperate medications in pharmaOffice and therefore would have different uuids.
Medication cannot be entered from pharmaoffice, only used, These are replicas of standard documents and are going to be maintained by afrobug software, pharmaoffice users can use
new formularies as they are published by the governing body. 

In pharmaOffice, products can have medication uuid to link a particular brand of product to a medication, for example, ferife ds would contain a uuid for athermter lumefantrine 80/480mg tablets.
ferife ds being the product can then be used for stock optimisation, prescription resolution and dispensing etc.
