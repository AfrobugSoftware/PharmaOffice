The mysql database manager create the query internally and returns a future with a type 
std::optional<pof::base::data>, if it a select query the optional contains the data, 
if it is not, then the validity of the optional signals the success of the operation
in both cases too

The mysql database can be accessed in the manager classes, busy waits are called via
wxGetApp().BusyWait("text"); The busy wait max duration is got from
wxGetApp().mBusyWaitDuration which is a std::chrono::system_clock::time_point::duration type
and failures are called wxGetApp().DatabaseFailed("text");
both these functions forward calls to MainFrame to draw to the screen

MainFrame needs a way to show the database is connected, connecting to the database is 
a problem i still need to figure out, but this is the approch I am going to take
